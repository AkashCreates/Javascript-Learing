// Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

// Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

// console.log("hello"); console.log("Akash");
// two statement

// JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

// But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.

console.log("Hello")
[(1, 2)].forEach(console.log);
